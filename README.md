# TMLPatcher

:exclamation: **Name Explanation** :exclamation: 

"Why is it called TML.Patcher when it's not capable of patching anything?"

That's pretty simple. The original and remaining goal of this project is to serve as an easy way to patch and modify .tmod files at the user's will. It's currently still in its early stages, however, and is only able to unpack and decompile .tmod files and their stored assemblies.

## Obligatory Disclaimer

This software is in no way affiliated with tModLoader, the tML team, or the tML brand. This is a purely fan-made, unendorsed tool to aid any users in unpacking, decompiling (and eventually patching) .tmod files at their own will. I do not condone or encourage stealing or otherwise maliciously using copyrighted content without consent directly from the copyright owner. This software was not made to allow a user to steal code, sprites, or any other assets packed in a .tmod file. This software was developed with the intention to allow better cross-mod compatibility and add-ons through the use of directly referencing DLLs, fixing bugs, cross-referencing conflicting code, and to examine mod code etc.

## Installation

Installation is extremely simple. All you need is .NET 5.0. Once you have .NET 5.0 installed, you should be able to download and unzip the attached file and run the .exe program. Running this will install ilspycmd and should automatically locate your Mod Loader\Mods folder.

## Usage

Using the program is pretty simple. I don't currently have the time to write out a full tutorial but all the options are self-explanatory. Do note that you need to extract a mod before decompiling it, though.
Download the attached file "TML.Patcher.zip".
